I intend to document some of my work with various WWW APIs using Scala.JS instead of JavaScript. First up:
[WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).

As I work through the examples in
_WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL_ by Kouichi Matsuda and Rodger Lea,
I will [publish them](/webgl-programming-guide-work).

Spent more time on chapter 7 than any other chapter so far, but I finally finished.
Next up, chapter 8, "Lighting and Hierarchical Objects."

I've been doing my own matrix algebra, partly because I enjoy a small, manageable challenge, and partly because I could not
find a good Scala 3 library that I could use from Scala.js. I've been able to manage basic things like multiplication with a
little help from ChatGPT. For chapter 8 though I had to calculate the inverse of a matrix. ChatGPT tried to generate some code
but blew up halfway through. Its second attempt used a library.

I went back to Google and finally found [Spire](https://typelevel.org/spire/), which supports both Scala3 and Scala.js.
If I am lucky, I will quickly figure out how to graft it into my existing matrix code, so I can treat matrix inversion as a
special case and go on my merry way. My fear is that I will get frustrated and decide it would be cleaner to rip out my
io.github.tsnee.webgl.math code and replace it with Spire, even if that means rewriting all the exercises I finished for
chapters 4, 7, and 8 so far.
I hope not - at halfway through chapter 8 of a ten chapter book, I feel like I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Spire looks great for vector math, but it's support for matrices was a ChatGPT hallucination.
[S.L.A.S.H](https://github.com/dragonfly-ai/slash) seems promising though.

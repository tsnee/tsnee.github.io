This is my first-ever blog post.

Yesterday I started reading
_WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL_ by Kouichi Matsuda and Rodger Lea,
published by my old publisher, Addison-Wesley.
I decided to follow along in Scala.JS instead of JavaScript. 
I will attempt to publish my work here.

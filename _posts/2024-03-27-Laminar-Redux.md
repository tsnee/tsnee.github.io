I mentioned Laminar [two weeks ago](2024-03-13-Second-Chapter.md).
I had originally dismissed it because it did not support functional effects.
After struggling with WebGL using only bare Scala.js, I decided something is better than nothing.
I spent the last three days adapting my [WebGL exercise code](/webgl-programming-guide-work/) to Laminar and did a fair bit
of refactoring while I was at it. I am not ashamed of the results. 

Speaking of the _WebGL Programming Guide_ I haven't made any progress [since my last post](2024-03-24-Ugh.md) because of the
Laminar work, but I am more than halfway through the last chapter. I predict that tomorrow I will be finished.
Then I will have to decide what to work on next.

I am tempted to plow ahead into WebGL 2. It would be the natural successor to my WebGL 1 work.
I finally joined [O'Reilly](www.oreilly.com) and there are a few WebGL 2 books that look good.
On the other hand, Scala.js doesn't support WebGL 2 ([yet](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-dom/pull/838)).
It would be nice to start applying my WebGL knowledge by working on a WebXR project.
Of course, the first project would have to be adding WebXR support to Scala.js.

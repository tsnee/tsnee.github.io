[Yesterday](../01/That-took-longer-than-expected.html) I finally finished the WebGL exercises in
_WebGL Programming Guide_.
My main motivation for learning WebGL was so I could play with [WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev/).
Unfortunately neither WebGL 2 nor WebXR are supported by Scala.js yet.
Last month I spent a few days writing facades for WebGL 2 and
[contributed them in a PR](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-dom/pull/838), which I hope will be merged soon.

I had thought I might avoid the same effort for WebXR by using [ScalablyTyped](https://scalablytyped.org/)
to generate facades for me from Typescript headers in the npm package `@types/webxr`. 
I was not successful in that effort though.
ScalablyTyped generates code that depends on other things that Scala.js doesn't support yet, like `DOMHighResTimeStamp`.
The generated code also uses types that Scala.js might not want to support, like WebGL's `GLenum` and `GLint`.
Finally, it refers to Typescript classes like `IterableIterator` that even I don't think belong in Scala.js.
It looks like people who want to work with WebXR in Scala.js will need to come up with their own facades.

Good progress on _WebGL Programming Guide_. I finished chapters 5 and 6 this morning and started on chapter 7.
Got sidetracked trying to do my own matrix math, rather than relying on a library.
Ended up breaking out my old college textbook _Computer Graphics_ by Donald Hearn and M. Pauline Baker.
The 1986 edition! Matrix algebra hasn't changed. Other things sure have though - I ended up turning to ChatGPT for help.

I spent yesterday with [Calico](https://www.armanbilge.com/calico/).
When I try a new library, I usually start by following the quick start guide. Since Calico doesn't have one yet,
[I wrote one](https://github.com/armanbilge/calico/pull/360).
I spent a fair bit of time writing instructions for how to set up a new sbt project before realizing that such tasks should be
automated. So I created [a Giter8 template](https://github.com/tsnee/scalajs-calico.g8).
That reduced the size of the quick start guide considerably.

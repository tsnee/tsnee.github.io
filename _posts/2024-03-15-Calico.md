I spent yesterday with [Calico](https://www.armanbilge.com/calico/).
When I try a new library, I usually start by following the quick start guide. Since Calico doesn't have one yet,
[I wrote one](https://github.com/armanbilge/calico/pull/360).
I spent a fair bit of time writing instructions for how to set up a new sbt project before realizing that such tasks should be
automated. So I created [a Giter8 template](https://github.com/tsnee/scalajs-calico.g8).
That reduced the size of the quick start guide considerably.

Calico is great! That said, it is still pre-1.0 and needs more work to become as fully-functional as Laminar. I've contributed
documentation and functionality PRs and encourage others to do the same. I think functional effects in front end code will
be a big benefit to people who want to work with APIs like WebGL that do most of their work in side effects.
